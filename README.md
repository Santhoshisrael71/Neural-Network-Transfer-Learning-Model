# Neural-Network-Transfer-Learning-Model

##  Project Description

This project demonstrates how to develop an image classification model using **Transfer Learning** with a pretrained **VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network** in PyTorch.

The model is trained on a custom dataset and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
